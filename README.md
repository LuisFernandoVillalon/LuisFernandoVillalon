My name is Luis F. Villalon, I love to challenge myself and improve myself by 1% everyday. I aspire to be employed as a Front-End/Web Developer based on my outstanding technical and interpersonal skills I have acquired and practiced.

Currently half-ways through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a> curriculum to teach myself full-stack web development. About to begin the back-end portion of the curriculum. Just finished the final project of the JavaScript portion, which was to create a Reddit-like clone. Actively looking for employment.
